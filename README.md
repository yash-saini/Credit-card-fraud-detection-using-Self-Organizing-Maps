# Credit-card-fraud-detection-using-Self-Organizing-Maps
This project illustrates the use of unsupervised ML technique called Self Organizing Maps to detect frauds committed in getting a credit card issued. The dataset has been downloaded from UCI machine learning repository. The frauds are the outliers encountered in the model. 
In addition to this , a hybrid approach of Supervised(ANN) + Unsupervised(SOM) learning techniques is also demonstrated.
